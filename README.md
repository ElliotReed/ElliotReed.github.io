# [Portfolio](https://elliotreed.github.io/ "Portfolio")

This is a responsive porfolio site built to display projects I have created. 
There are links to contact information as well as individual GitHub "pages" projects.

## CSS
___
All CSS used in this site was created by myself, with the exception of the reset file.

This allows for working with flexbox and grid. I'm also using CSS variables.

## ToDo
***

* Move load script to seperate file
* Randomly order the portfolio pieces.
