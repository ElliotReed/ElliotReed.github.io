# Responsive Portfolio

This is a responsive porfolio site built to display projects I have created. 
There are links to contact information as well as individual GitHub "pages" projects.

## CSS

All CSS used in this site was created by myself, with the exception of the reset file.

This allows for working with flexbox and grid. I'm also using CSS variables.

## ToDo
1. Randomly order the portfolio pieces.
